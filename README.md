Want to get a drink? 

  That is the fundimental question this app is asking. I wanted to get to know a little bit about the user, and then encourage them to offer a date and time to get a drink. 


  When at one point during the writing of my yes/no questions, my code was a mess of branching if/elseif statements. I couldnt keep them straight, but I also didnt want to give up the neat user experience that allowed for slightly different questions depending on their response. 

  Fortunatly, a stroll through the documentation for a couple of the things we had discussed in class brought me to the arrays page of MDN. There I found this: 
    
    console.log(array1.includes(2));
  
  I decided to play with it a bit, and found the key to this whole app: 
    
    if(answer.includes(book.toLowerCase())){

    }
  After that it was mostly tidying up, a bit of HTML here, a bit of CSS there, and viola! 

Enjoy! 

ps. we should get a drink! 
pps. my partner is a python dev. In this house, we use snake_case.
